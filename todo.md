# todo

## Round 1 (figure-it-out): port a slice, derive the intent
- [x] Slice ported and graded against SIMH (square_root, four calc routines, frame Network)
- [x] Functions removed; topology pure Petri (option a)
- [x] INTENT.md, docs/decisions.tsv

## Round 2 (feature): the reach tool, and the files brought up to what is settled
- [x] Data shape first: a Step per executed instruction (pc, AC, IO, effective address, op); places named by bound Record field, else listing variable or label
- [x] tools/reach_oracle.py over spacewar-c's 17 scripted matches; self-checks: copy of core vs SIMH, word arithmetic model vs SIMH's AC
- [x] Report saved: docs/reach-oracle.txt
- [x] Network contracts (reads:/writes:); top Network must declare its boundary; frame declares writes: display; mutation caught
- [x] pdp1.py: bind explosion_cloud.particles, square_root_call; note instruction-held fields; binding holds only what play cannot observe
- [x] RUNS sources annotated for the presentation split and power-on words
- [x] INTENT.md rewritten to what is settled; decisions.tsv rows
- [x] All checks re-run green
- skip: architect/arena for the tool: its shape follows SIMH's history format and the existing frame driver; nothing to choose between
- skip: a planted-defect test of the tool: every kind it reports except far jumps has a true positive in real play, and both self-checks compare against SIMH
- [ ] Open: a field-level classifier for gameplay vs presentation (by consequence) once more of the game is ported
- [x] Port the spaceship; play never observes mot's reads past the outline array (round 6)
- [x] The boundary's inputs: console (test word, control boxes), power-on score and game count, start address (round 5)
- [x] The sense switches the spaceship reads (round 6); switch 4 with the heavens (round 8)
- [ ] Open: runs-spec is untouched; it still says what the user called directionally right, wrong in details

## Round 3 (autonomous): compile multiply, divide, sincos from RUNS
- [x] multiply: RUNS mpy + imp Network, check_multiply vs SIMH, pdp1/multiply.toml, runsc networks/calls/byname/dword, MATCH, gate
- [x] divide: RUNS dvd + idv Network, division enum for the skip, check_divide vs SIMH, block/skips/io_param/cells in the binding, MATCH, gate
- [x] sincos: RUNS sin/cos Networks over mpy, check_sincos vs SIMH on all 2^18 words, exit-first loop layout + block_takes_entry, MATCH, gate
- [x] sincos saturation branch: no word of 2^18 reaches it (exhaustive run by hand, round 9); only the image gate covers the branch's code

## Round 4 (autonomous): compile tunables and objects from RUNS
- [x] tunables: all twelve xct tunables as Processors, the numbers as tunables fields; check_tunables vs SIMH; pdp1/tunables.toml with the machine's words (sequence break, start vectors, control word slot); XCT + ac_param, [names], MINUS_ZERO in runsc; MATCH, gate
- [x] objects: explosion, torpedo, in_hyperspace, breakout compiled from RUNS; RUNS reshaped where the original carries a register (diff's position, the dots' IO, hyperspace's IO, the jump's swap, a cla per diff); runsc: cursors, inline macros, pending AC results, Network guards/loops, bottom-tested loops, shared tail, shift homes, dpy, enum spelling; MATCH, gate

## Round 5 (autonomous): compile the main loop and game control from RUNS
- [x] RUNS: start Networks, frame, object_loop, between_games/ask/show_scores/new_match/new_game, control_word; score/console/controls/lights/scoreboard/outline_call/outline_space
- [x] Language: fields with no initial value come in (top Networks declare them); `wait`; several top Networks are one game
- [x] check_game.py vs SIMH: 3000 seeded cases, 17 scripted matches (51000 stops), control word; 14 mutations caught
- [x] pdp1/main_loop.toml + runsc rules (table, walk, cursors' homes, carry, stray, blocks, repeat, jumping guards, enum sign/zero tests, xor sharing, devices, flags, hlt+wait, clearing loop, dispatch); MATCH; gate 263/263
- [x] Confirmed with the spaceship port: play never observes the carried outline word (mot) for torpedoes (check_frame poison)

## Round 6 (autonomous): compile the spaceship from RUNS
- [x] RUNS: spaceship.runs (first/second_spaceship, spaceship, accelerate, after_outline, launch_torpedo), spaceship.runs-prim; records spaceship, pen, launch; console sense switches; handoff fields
- [x] Language: enums may share a member name (resolved by type); evaluator fix: a field's name is not a Record mention
- [x] check_spaceship vs SIMH: 3000 calls through the compiled outline (tools/outline.py stand-in); 17 mutations (14 caught, 1 after one-free-slot tables, 2 equivalent)
- [x] check_frame with flying ships: 1500 frames; poison mode for the mot verdict, with its control
- [x] pdp1/spaceship.toml + runsc rules (exit, back/pulse externs, carried homed jump, slot-field cursors and search, sense/flag guards, shared Network tail, pool-word dispatch); MATCH; gate 357/357
- [x] The outline compiler and outlines (presentation): ported in round 7; tools/outline.py deleted

## Round 7 (autonomous): port the outline compiler, the outlines and the core layout
- [x] Design: instructions as values of the machine description's type insn in a Record (outline_code), run by `jump` with the PDP-1's rules; compiler as a Network cut at the original's labels. Alternatives weighed: one Processor (cannot call ocs; its order is not the original's), raw words (would put macro1's pool addresses in the text)
- [x] Evaluator: type insn, instruction constructors, jump with contract and bound, initial values a slot, slots past a collection are errors, Network loop exit that runs things first
- [x] RUNS: outlines.runs, outlines.runs-prim; outlines, outline_code, outline_compiler Records; pen.saved_x/y; outline_space and the outline enum gone; frame contract without pen
- [x] Bindings: core_layout.toml, outlines.toml, outline_compiler.toml; [[code]] draw_outline; [into]; MATCH; check_compiled 423/423
- [x] check_outline_compiler vs SIMH (9 outlines, 6 ddd settings); 10 compiler mutations caught; check_spaceship/check_frame through the ported code; `moved` relocation; 5 machine-rule mutations caught
- [x] reach_oracle re-run: same findings, code space named outline_code
- [x] The heavens and the star catalog (round 8)
- [ ] Open: runsc's layout rules grow per unit (jump table, rotated loop); an independent review should judge whether each is general

## Round 8 (autonomous): port the heavens and the star catalog; every unit from RUNS
Playbook (autonomous run), verbatim:
- [x] 1. State the exit condition as a checkable predicate before the first iteration (tests green, repro fixed, all N PRs merged, pixel-diff zero).
- skip: 2. Pick the wake mechanism (loop skill): no external event to watch; every check runs in the foreground
- [x] 3. Each iteration makes the smallest change the evidence justifies, verifies it against the predicate, commits if it advanced, discards changes that didn't help.
- [x] 4. Mid-run discoveries are yours.
- [x] 5. Checkpoint every iteration via the show-me-your-work skill.
- [x] 6. Stop when the predicate is met.

Predicate: runsc MATCH 8744e9c9 with all 13 build/lift/*.c generated, none symlinked, and build/lift holding only generated files; check_compiled passes; check_heavens (central_star, expensive_planetarium vs SIMH, wrap paths, mutations) passes; check_frame runs whole frames; check_all.sh passes.

- [x] RUNS: central_star, star_line, star_slope, draw_star; expensive_planetarium, show_magnitude, move_window; star_catalog Record; sense switch 4
- [x] Evaluator check vs SIMH (check_heavens.py): seeded + edge cases + scan-wrap paths, 66/66 statements; 23 mutations caught
- [x] check_frame through the heavens (whole frames); poison patch moved to the patch space
- [x] Bindings pdp1/heavens.toml, pdp1/star_catalog.toml + runsc rules; MATCH; check_compiled 2365/2365
- [x] Remove bridges to lifted C ([names], [[extern]], includes, symlinks); build/lift holds only the 13 generated files; strace: no spacewar-c/lift file opened
- [x] deslop; docs (INTENT, pdp1/README, todo); decisions.tsv
- [ ] Open: runsc's layout rules for the planetarium (arms apart, exit_after, place comparisons) are shaped by one routine; an independent review should judge them
- [ ] Open: a full window cycle of the planetarium (2*16*020000 frames in a row) is not run; set-word frames cover the margins instead

## Round 9 (autonomous): close the review's holes in "the text holds the game, the binding no logic"
Playbook (autonomous run), verbatim:
- [x] 1. State the exit condition as a checkable predicate before the first iteration (tests green, repro fixed, all N PRs merged, pixel-diff zero).
- skip: 2. Pick the wake mechanism (loop skill): no external event to watch; every check runs in the foreground or a background job I wait on
- [x] 3. Each iteration makes the smallest change the evidence justifies, verifies it against the predicate, commits if it advanced, discards changes that didn't help.
- [x] 4. Mid-run discoveries are yours.
- [x] 5. Checkpoint every iteration via the show-me-your-work skill.
- [x] 6. Stop when the predicate is met.

Predicate: runsc MATCH 8744e9c9; the extended check_compiled passes (every mutant of numbers, field references, operators, statement deletion and adjacent swaps changes the image, is refused, or is evaluator-equivalent on seeded states); each reviewer mutant re-run is changed/refused/equivalent; check_all.sh passes on the final commit; findings 1-10 fixed or declined with a logged reason.

- [x] Gate: structural mutants + evaluator equivalence, every same-type field swap, every binding key live (findings 6, 7)
- [x] Dead binding keys gone; schema: unknown keys, missing keys and names that name nothing are errors (6)
- [x] runsc checks the program as the evaluator does, plus a static scope check; crashes are BindErrors (3)
- [x] Enum members resolved by the field's enum (4)
- [x] carry derived from draw_outline's jump; refused when the walk does not load it for every slot that jumps (1)
- [x] Shared words and registers: each RUNS read is of the name the word holds there, else a bit-level proof it is unused (2)
- [x] [share] (via shared words) and stray checked; skip return set on every path (5)
- [x] pdp1/devices.toml: sense switches, lights, start vectors in one place (8)
- [x] check_game: UNKNOWN in the evaluator where SIMH knows is a failure, but for the lights (9)
- [x] Docs: INTENT Verified, README contract, flush, saturation (10)
- [x] deslop, check_all on the final commit, decisions.tsv
- [ ] Open: no independent reviewer has re-read runsc's shared-words check and the bit-level proof (BLOCKED: independent review in this subagent)
- [ ] Open: the gate does not mutate a match's arms or insert statements; cross-type field swaps were swept once by hand (939, none silent), not in the gate

## Round 10 (autonomous): close reviewer C's holes
Playbook (autonomous run), verbatim:
- [x] 1. State the exit condition as a checkable predicate before the first iteration (tests green, repro fixed, all N PRs merged, pixel-diff zero).
- skip: 2. Pick the wake mechanism (loop skill): no external event to watch; every check runs in the foreground or a background job I wait on
- [x] 3. Each iteration makes the smallest change the evidence justifies, verifies it against the predicate, commits if it advanced, discards changes that didn't help.
- [x] 4. Mid-run discoveries are yours.
- [x] 5. Checkpoint every iteration via the show-me-your-work skill.
- [x] 6. Stop when the predicate is met.

Predicate: runsc MATCH 8744e9c9; reviewer C's harnesses (hC_gen, hC_gen2, hC_decl, hC_bfuzz, hC_elem) re-run at HEAD show 0 silent-and-different, 0 crashes, every declaration drop caught; the extended check_compiled passes; check_all.sh passes on the final code commit; findings 1-6 fixed or declined with a logged reason.

- [x] 1. "One value in two places" peephole sound; every other runsc peephole audited for unchecked assumptions
- [x] 2. Gate: dup, move, insert, run target, negate, branch swap, match arms, cross-type/record field, declaration drops, binding list elements and values
- [x] 3. runs.check: declarations checked against bodies both ways; requires decided
- [x] 4. runs.check: static types
- [x] 5. runsc crashes become BindErrors at their cause
- [x] 6. Dead list element handoff.swap; the gate catches dead list elements
- [x] deslop, docs, decisions.tsv, check_all (972027f: full gate 39,847 mutants and check_all pass)
- [x] Audit (subagent) of every runsc peephole: two more holes fixed (a block's run in tail position; the jump-back run's arguments); loop bounds kept as RUNS's check, judged by firing
- [ ] Open: the audit's rules judged unchecked but guarded by the image in practice (held guards, shared xor, spill, preinc, shift-table `known`, jump-table range, pending results, slot chain) have no mutant that builds MATCH; no rule makes them sound by construction
- [ ] Open: no independent reviewer has re-read this round's runs.check type and declaration rules (BLOCKED: independent review in this subagent)

## Round 11 (fix wave): close reviewer D's holes
- [x] 1. runsc dispatch: an arm's run passes the scrutinee's slot; gate kind `argument`; audit (subagent) of every pattern match: match coverage, word operator arity, statements after a jump out, now runs.check errors
- [x] 2. Unused parameters and locals rejected; place_torpedo's slot gone; sine_answer's dropped half is `_`
- [x] 3. Static checks: ordering compares, 18-bit numbers, constant slots, break/continue placement, constant compares, return without a value
- [x] 4. outline_code's count reserved after the table; the star catalog follows it (no `at`)
- [x] 5. INTENT: bounds are RUNS's checks, not proofs; the twelve bounds listed
- [x] 6. Every initial value mutated; a silent one judged by 60 games from power-on
- [x] Evaluator: a bound that fails to evaluate stops the firing at the bound
- [ ] Open: runs-spec's check_examples fails two examples under the stricter checks (DIGS #8 now rejected for its ordering compare; NETWORK_TOPOLOGY's size_cloud never reads its slot); runs-spec is outside this round
- [ ] Open: audit's latent miscompiles (with_operand vs rotated_operand; held guards) have no MATCH mutant; no rule makes them sound by construction

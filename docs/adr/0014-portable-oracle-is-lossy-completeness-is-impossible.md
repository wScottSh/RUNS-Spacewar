# The Portable Oracle is a lossy projection with a fault-model residual — completeness is impossible, not deferred

Status: accepted (closes, permanently, the recurring "can we make a perfect/complete Oracle?" question; the consequence of ADR-0012's fault-model clause applied to the Realization-facing decode)

This ADR exists to **end a conversation that has recurred at least three times.** The answer to "can the Oracle — or the Portable Oracle — be made perfect/complete?" is not "not yet" and not "it's hard." It is **impossible**, on three independent theoretical results *plus this project's own prior doctrine*. If you are reading this because you are tempted to build a *completeness witness* for the Portable Oracle, or to "just implement the complete oracle" — **stop, and read this first. It already answers you.**

## The decision

A **perfect / complete** Oracle — one whose *passing proves* a Realization is behaviorally identical to Ground Truth — **cannot exist** for the entangled/stateful majority of Spacewar. Therefore neither can a perfectly-complete **Portable Oracle** (the lossy, address-free projection defined in `CONTEXT.md`).

The achievable ceiling is **best-effort inside a fault model**: exhaustive Vectors on the bounded math island (a genuine proof there, ADR-0004), branch-complete Traces everywhere else, and — for the Portable Oracle — a **lossy projection with a named residual**. "Implement the complete oracle" is **not a selectable option**; it misrepresents an impossibility as a backlog item.

This is a **floor established by mathematics, not a gap left by effort.** More engineering tightens the sample and lights more branches; it *never* removes the residual.

## Why — three independent walls, then our own doctrine

**1. No finite suite pins an unbounded function (FSM conformance).** For *any* finite test suite `T` with longest trace length `N`, one can constructively build a faulty implementation that agrees with Ground Truth for the first `N` inputs and then diverges: it passes `T` identically yet is a different function. Completeness requires restricting the space of candidate implementations — a **fault domain** / bounded state count. Chow's W-method is complete *only* under a state bound, and Chow justified that bound by **white-box** analysis of the design, never by black-box observation.
- *Completeness of FSM Test Suites Reconsidered*, arXiv:2410.19405 — https://arxiv.org/html/2410.19405v1 — "For any (finite) test suite T for 𝒮, we can trivially construct a faulty implementation that passes T"; a fault domain is a **necessary precondition**, not an optional tightening.
- *FSM-based conformance testing methods: A survey*, ScienceDirect — https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950584910001278 — W-method completeness requires a bounded-state assumption, justified white-box.

**2. No finite experiment identifies hidden state (Moore 1956).** Observed transitions are always consistent with a *larger* machine carrying state the experiment never distinguished. A dropped machine-timing word (e.g. the `mtc` instruction-count budget, source line 665/677) is a concrete instance of exactly this hidden state.
- E. F. Moore, *Gedanken-Experiments on Sequential Machines* (1956) — https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Gedanken-Experiments-on-Sequential-Machines-Moore/a6021735e8de4f32010c6313396432d99bbe2440 — "there exist other machines experimentally distinguishable from S for which the original experiment would have had the same outcome."

**3. Equivalence and "is X ever read" are undecidable in general (Rice).** Behavioral equivalence of two programs, *and* "does Ground Truth ever read address X to compute the next frame," are both non-trivial semantic properties → no algorithm decides them in general. The load-bearing corollary: **dynamic reachability ≠ static reachability.** "Never read forward across the traces we ran" **cannot** be upgraded to "never read forward on any reachable execution."
- *Rice's theorem*, Wikipedia — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem.

**4. We already wrote this down — this ADR just makes it un-reopenable.** ADR-0012: *"No finite black-box suite proves equivalence of two arbitrary transducers"*; the residual is *"the floor … not a defect to engineer away."* ADR-0004 hard-codes enumeration-as-proof *only* where input-domain cardinality (fixed by instruction width) permits, and branch-complete elsewhere. This ADR is that doctrine, restated for the Portable Oracle so the question stops recurring.

## Consequences — the Portable Oracle's projection rules

The Portable Oracle drops PDP-1 implementation artifacts (machine-timing words, self-modified code addresses). Which drops are legitimate is governed by these rules, which follow directly from the walls above:

- **Read-set analysis is inclusion-only.** A word *observed read-forward* on the Traces **provably belongs** in the portable fingerprint — use this to catch a load-bearing field someone was about to drop. It **may never certify a drop** — that is the undecidable direction (wall 3). It is a *risk-reducer, not a completeness proof*. **Never call it a "witness."**
- **Drops are white-box engineering arguments, not witnesses.** The only legitimate justification for dropping a word is a reading of the PDP-1 **source** arguing the word never feeds the dynamics — Chow's own "justify by design analysis" move. Label it an *engineering argument*; it is not a black-box proof and must not masquerade as one.
- **A wrong drop is a deliberate supersede.** A dropped word later shown to matter is a `deviation_manifest` / supersede entry (the ADR-0012 mechanism) — the residual has a home; it is never laundered into "proven complete."
- **"Same" is exact, never epsilon.** Within the kept fields, equality is exact — bit-exact on raw numeric words, enum identity on decoded state fields. The residual lives entirely in *what is kept vs dropped*, never in a tolerance.

## Do not reopen

If a future session proposes a "completeness witness," a "perfect fingerprint," or "let's just implement the complete oracle" — **it is already answered here: impossible, by Rice + Moore (1956) + FSM-conformance, and by our own ADR-0012.** The honest option set is always *how tight a best-effort*, and **never** *best-effort vs. complete*.

## Revisit trigger

Only a change in the **fault model** reopens this — e.g. if a Realization is constrained to a provably bounded state space that a W-method-style argument could exploit. Absent a white-box state bound on the Realization, the residual stands. A divergence discovered in the field is **not** a revisit; it is a supersede that grows the sample (ADR-0012), leaving this decision intact.

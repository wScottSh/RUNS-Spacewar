"""The image must come from the RUNS text, not from the binding. Builds the
image once (it must match the oracle), then mutates the RUNS of every
routine and field the bindings compile, one change at a time:

- each number, and each field's initial value, one up;
- each field reference to each other field of its Record (of its type, and
  of another type), and to the field of the same name in another Record;
- each operator to another (+ and -, < and >=, & and |, and and or, ...);
- each enum member to another of its enum;
- each run of a routine to each other routine of its kind and arity, and
  each of its arguments to 0, to 1, to itself plus 1, to its negation and
  to each other name in scope;
- each guard negated; an if's arm swapped with its else, and its first two
  arms with each other; each two arms of a match swapped;
- each statement deleted, duplicated, swapped with the next, and moved to
  every other place in its block;
- a statement inserted after each let and set: a set of each other place
  the routine sets to the same value; and a step of its own place
  (`set p = p + 1`) inserted before it and after it;
- each set of a field at a Processor's top level made a local of the
  field's name, which the Processor's later statements read instead;
- each Record a Processor declares under reads: or writes:, and each
  requires:, deleted;

and mutates each binding: each key line and each section deleted, each
element of a list or an inline table deleted, and each value replaced (a
name by each other name of its shape the binding uses, a number one up and
one down, a flag flipped). A binding mutant must build another image or be
refused; one that builds the image is dead, unless the value it replaced is
a name the binding gives a C word (a cursor, the table, a block, an exit,
a slot), which never reaches the image: it is renamed.

Each RUNS mutant is classified. It changes the image; or the evaluator
rejects the text before anything runs (runs.check); or runsc refuses it
with a BindError naming the RUNS construct. A mutant that builds the
original image is silent, and passes only when the evaluator shows it is
the same game: the mutated routine, and failing that each bound routine
that compiles it, fired on seeded random Records before and after the
mutation must leave the same Records, the same points and the same error,
with at least a quarter of the firings running clean. A requires: is a
precondition, not code: its deletion passes when every firing it lets run
leaves the same, and it stops some firing (else it is dead). Any other
silent mutant, and any crash of runsc, fails the gate. A loop's bound is
RUNS's check that the loop ends, not code, and compiles to nothing: a
mutant of it is not built, and passes when every firing leaves the same or
stops the mutant at its bound.

Usage: [--sample N] [--only TEXT] [--kinds a,b] (build N mutants drawn by
a seeded shuffle, not all; only those whose label holds TEXT; only those
kinds).

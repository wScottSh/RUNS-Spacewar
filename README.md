# Spacewar! 3.1 in RUNS

Spacewar! 3.1 (MIT, 1962) written in RUNS, verbatim: the exact game over every sequence of inputs from power-on, glitches included. RUNS is specified in [runs-spec](https://github.com/enduring-game-standard/runs-spec).

`INTENT.md` says what RUNS is for and what this port settled. `docs/decisions.tsv` logs each decision with its evidence. `docs/adr/` holds the architecture decisions, including the earlier verification method's; ADR-0017 says which still hold. `CONTEXT.md` is that method's glossary.

## Layout

- `runs/` is the game. Records and Networks are in `*.runs`, Processors in `*.runs-prim`.
- `pdp1/` is the PDP-1 binding: how the PDP-1 carries the RUNS text. It holds only choices that play cannot observe. `pdp1/README.md` states the contract.
- `tools/runs.py` is the reference evaluator. It parses RUNS, checks it, and runs it.
- `tools/runsc.py` compiles the RUNS text and the binding back to the original tape image, byte for byte. It emits the C dialect of [spacewar-c](https://github.com/wScottSh/spacewar-c), and spacewar-c's `pdp1cc` compiles that.
- `tools/check_*.py` compare each RUNS routine, run by the evaluator, with the original running in the SIMH PDP-1 simulator.
- `tools/check_compiled.py` changes the RUNS text and the binding one edit at a time. Each edit must change the image, be refused, or be shown to leave the game the same.
- `oracle/` holds input and output vectors recorded from the original, which some checks read. `source/` is the original listing and Norbert Landsteiner's "Inside Spacewar!" notes.

## Run the checks

Put spacewar-c beside this repository and build its oracle and SIMH as its README says. Then run:

```sh
tools/check_all.sh
```

It prints `MATCH` when the image compiled from RUNS has the original's sha256, `8744e9c9c8540cc5075c5cbb91c56745a4305fdf8e7afca43bea2e9e04ca4bdf`, and then one line for each check.

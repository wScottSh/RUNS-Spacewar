processor collision_response_destroy
inputs:
  collided: bool
  is_alive: spacewar:is_alive
outputs:
  is_alive: spacewar:is_alive

; Simple collision response: mark entity as destroyed
; Used for ship-star, ship-ship, and torpedo-ship collisions

if collided:
  is_alive = false

; Note: Respawn behavior handled by game mode logic
; - Instant respawn mode: Runtime recreates ship Record next tick
; - Game over mode: Ship remains dead, game ends when both dead
